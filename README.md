# Oculus_Switcher
App allowing fast switching between stock Oculus Dash and Oculus Killer.

This app is based from Oculus Killer. Supports both .EXE and .DLL versions of oculus killer.

 Usage:
 1.Download app.
 2.Put it anywhere
 3.It will launch Oculus App with swapped Oculus Dash
 4.To revert close either app or Oculus App.

 For convenience I suggest placing this app into separate folder.

 To use your dash killer option place it ino "kilr" folder which is automatically created on first app run.
 .EXE version should be named OculusDash.exe
 .DLL version should be named version.dll
 Both versions do the same, but according to kaitlyn, the original author of oculus killer .Dll version eats additional 70 mb so priority
 goes like this
 First to load goes .EXE version from "kilr" folder, if not present then
 Second to load goes .DLL version from "kilr" folder, if neither present
 Third to load goes embeded .EXE version.
